# Profile Image Change Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps:

1. ✅ **ChangeProfileForm**: Modified to refresh user data after successful image upload
2. ✅ **HeaderSection**: Added refresh mechanism for avatar display
3. ✅ **ProfileCubit**: Updated to return image URL from uploadImage method
4. ✅ **SupabaseAuthService**: Added debug logging for database operations
5. ✅ **StorageService**: Fixed file path issue
6. ✅ **RLS Policy**: Identified and requested policy fix (auth.uid() = auth_id)

## Current Status:
- All code changes implemented
- RLS policy needs to be updated in Supabase dashboard
- Ready for testing once policy is corrected

## Next Steps:
1. Update RLS policy in Supabase to use `(auth.uid() = auth_id)`
2. Test image upload functionality
3. Verify avatar appears in HeaderSection after upload
